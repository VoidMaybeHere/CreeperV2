    CRITICAL:
        GETWORDS() - get the tracked words in a guild
        

Commands:
    Track - Track a new word
        Problems:
            Generate defaults per server (Need to find a way to detect new server added)
            Should creeper be default? If not should there be any defaults?
            Should there be a maximum allowed per server? Minimum?
    Ignore - Ignore a specific member (per server)
        Problems:
            Should it be until unignored? or for duration
            How should it be stored?
            Permissions, who should be able to ignore people?
            Should higher Permissions be able to bypass?
    Unignore - Remove member from ignored list
        Problems:
            Should an admin be able to unignore self?
             - Who should be able to bypass if no?
            How to avoid errors if not on ignored list?
